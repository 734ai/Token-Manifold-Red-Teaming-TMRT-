# TMRT Project Status - August 11, 2025

## âœ… COMPLETED (Phase 1 - Setup)
- [x] Repository structure created as specified in README.md
- [x] Python package setup with pyproject.toml
- [x] Core module implementations:
  - [x] unicode_mutators.py - Homoglyphs, invisible chars, normalization variants
  - [x] embedding_optimizer.py - White-box gradient ascent + token projection
  - [x] scaffolder.py - Email/chat/log/JSON role scaffolding
  - [x] verifier.py - Attack success evaluation with multiple metrics
  - [x] novelty_detector.py - TF-IDF + semantic similarity duplicate detection
  - [x] search_controller.py - DEAP evolutionary framework integration
  - [x] utils.py - Configuration, logging, sanitization utilities
- [x] Configuration system (YAML) with toy/full/sweep configs  
- [x] Demo script and Jupyter notebook
- [x] Docker containerization with entrypoint
- [x] Findings export in Kaggle competition JSON schema
- [x] CLI interface (run_tmrt.py) for easy access

## ðŸ”„ NEXT PHASE (Testing & Integration)
- [ ] Install dependencies and test toy demo with GPT-2
- [ ] Validate Unicode mutations produce different tokenizations
- [ ] Test role scaffolding generates convincing contexts  
- [ ] Verify attack verifier metrics work correctly
- [ ] Run novelty detector against known jailbreak corpus
- [ ] Execute mini evolutionary search (5 individuals, 3 generations)
- [ ] Debug any integration issues between components

## ðŸ“‹ PHASE 3 (Production Experiments)
- [ ] Configure for GPT-OSS-20b model access
- [ ] Run normalization sweep experiment (100 seed prompts)
- [ ] Run embedding probe experiment (white-box attacks)
- [ ] Execute full evolutionary search (50 individuals, 100 generations)
- [ ] Triage results with novelty detector
- [ ] Export top findings in competition format
- [ ] Prepare reproducibility documentation

## ðŸ“ˆ COMPETITION TIMELINE
- **Due**: August 26, 2025 (15 days remaining)
- **Target**: Submit 3-5 novel findings with high-quality writeup
- **Priority**: Focus on novelty and reproducibility

## ðŸš€ READY TO RUN
```bash
# Quick start commands available:
./run_tmrt.py --mode full                    # Full toy demo
./run_tmrt.py --mode unicode                 # Test Unicode mutations  
./run_tmrt.py --mode scaffold                # Test role scaffolding
python -m tmrt.demo --config configs/toy_demo.yaml --verbose
```

Framework is complete and ready for validation testing!
